href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm">How
Does the Internet Work?</a> by Rus Shuler</h2>
<p><strong>STATUS</strong>: Completed</p>
<p><strong>EFFORT</strong>: 2 coffees</p>
<p>Excellent read, explains everything at a very high level without
being too lossy with information. Only issue: it is a bit outdated, so
the experiments don’t work or not as well (and some are
Windows-specific).</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I learned:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Every computer needs an IP address (permanent or temporary) to
communicate through the Internet. Also, we have effectively ran out of
‘static’ (i.e. permanent) IP addresses! Or we had, at least. Only in
2017 the new system of IP addresses, IP version 6, was made Internet
Standard. The move was (is?) somewhat expensive and therefore slow. For
context, the previous version of IP addresses, version 4, only allows
2^32 possible combinations (~4 billion), whereas this new version allows
for 128 bits of information (~many trillion trillion
possibilities).</p></li>
<li><p>How do we turn a stream of bits into useful information? This is
accomplished by using the <strong>protocol stack</strong>. The stack is
just a bunch of rules and conventions to interpret data (bits) and
direct it to the appropriate places. The protocol stack on the Internet
is referred to as TCP/IP. It is divided into four sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Protocol Layer:</strong> Protocols that are
specific to an Internet service, such as the WWW or e-mail.</li>
<li><strong>Transmission Control Protocol Layer (TCP):</strong> Protocol
directing information (packets) to or from applications within the
computer, or to/from the IP Layer below. The addresses it uses to manage
the exchange are called ports.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Protocol Layer (IP):</strong> Protocol for
directing the packets to another computer, using IP addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Layer</strong>: Converts packets (bits) to network
signals and back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Routers have a directory of IP addresses, so they can ‘route’ the
data to their destination. However, routers usually do not have the
necessary address. When that happens they send the packets to a ‘bigger’
router which has more IP addresses. There the process is repeated if
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Most users don’t deal directly with IP addresses but rather with
<strong>domain names</strong>, e.g. ‘www.google.com’. How does a web
browser knows where to send the packets? Simple: it uses a
<strong>Domain Name Service (DNS)</strong>. Similar to routers, a DNS
has a directory, but in this case it contains information matching
domain names to IP addresses. Again, if the DNS doesn’t find the domain
name, it relies on a bigger DNS, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>The World Wide Web (WWW) needs a protocol for sending and
receiving websites. The most used one by far is HTTP. I won’t summarize
the description of how this works, since I think the explanation in the
article is already succinct and well written.</p></li>
<li><p>I didn’t understand much of the TCP/IP protocols from this
article. Could use more details here.</p></li>

Internet Infrastructure Works</a> by Jeff Tyson</h2>
<p><strong>STATUS</strong>: Completed</p>
<p><strong>EFFORT</strong>: 1/2 coffee</p>
<p>An OK read, not very informative (and outdated). Some valuable
nuggets of information but not worth the time, in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned-1">What I learned:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.internetsociety.org">The Internet
Society</a> is a thing! They “oversee the formation of the policies and
protocols that define how we use and interact with the Internet”, among
other things.</p></li>
<li><p>Mbps = megabits per second. MBps = mega<em>bytes</em> per
second.</p></li>
<li><p>Internet backbones are typically fiber optic trunk lines</p></li>
<li><p>URL = Uniform Resource Locator. Top-level domain examples =
{.com, .gov, .edu, .org}. Second-level domain examples = {yahoo, google,
microsoft}.</p></li>
<li><p>DNS servers cache: they save IP addresses for requests resolved
with the help of another DNS.</p></li>
<li><p>“All of the machines on the Internet are either servers or
clients”</p></li>
<li><p>An ISP give you a temporary IP address (that is set for your
session only) so that they don’t have to remember IP addresses for every
customer, only for the modems they have.</p></li>
</ul>

href="http://igoro.com/archive/what-really-happens-when-you-navigate-to-a-url/">What
really happens when you navigate to a URL</a> by Igor Ostrovsky</h2>
<p><strong>STATUS</strong>: Completed</p>
<p><strong>EFFORT</strong>: 0 coffees!</p>
<p>10/10 article. Concise and to the point. Actually helpful diagrams.
Concrete and relatable examples. It gave me some insight into how an
HTTP interaction might actually go about.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned-2">What I learned:</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the browser is trying to find an IP address from a domain name
it checks the items below in order until if finds the address.
<ol type="1">
<li>Its own cache (Browser cache).</li>
<li>OS cache.</li>
<li>Router’s cache.</li>
<li>ISP’s DNS cache.</li>
<li>If it still hasn’t found the address then the DNS will redirect to
other DNSs recursively (all the way until the root nameserver).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Suppose you are looking for the services of a big domain name, like
facebook.com. Clearly one server will not be able to handle all the
clients that are looking for facebook.com. There are several ways around
this.
<ul>
<li>Round-robin DNS: The DNS lookup returns multiple IP addresses rather
than just one.</li>
<li>Load-balancer: The DNS returns the IP address of a load-balancer,
which is a piece of hardware that forwards requests to other servers,
depending on how busy they are.</li>
<li>Geographic DNS: The DNS returns an IP address which depends on where
the client is located. Great for static content (not great for dynamic
content since the different servers across the world have to coordinate
so they show the same information).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
