TL;DR: Nobody seems to agree on why HTTP cookies are named so.

There are many theories; I'll just present two.

**Closest to the truth but unsatisfactory:** Derived from 'magic cookie', a term coined in the 7th edition of the "UNIX Programmer's Manual", published in 1979. It appeared on a man page, and in that context it referred to a small piece of data used to communicate between two programs. Why the writer(s) decided to use 'magic cookie' is unknown, as far as I can tell.

**No evidence but makes most sense:** A reference to fortune cookies, since these contain a small and opaque piece of text. Coupling this with the existence of the 'fortune' program on UNIX makes this believable.
